# MHR-PrefabFixer
Prefab Fixer for the v13 update to Sunbreak

* Pick a folder
* The program will search for any .pfb files within the subfolders
* Will copy the folder to a new conversion folder to avoid messing with the originals
* Attempt to convert old prefab files to new prefab format

I've tried this on all the mods I currently have, Elden ring hairstyle, Physics enabler etc. only issue was the Feminine Hunter Animations PAck. (I will normally try to provide the Feminine Hunter Animations Pack update to the author when prefabs have been updated, and they will be responsible to update)

Note: Please be aware that this fixes the body/hair meshes. Weapons are not included as those have undergone, quite a bit of a change compared to a simple byte change. It it being looked into, but may take a while. In the meantime, alphaZomega has released a new version of their 010 editor script to fix the remaining weapon issue, so feel free to grab their script and run it against your prefabs.
