# MHR-PrefabFixer
Prefab Fixer for the v11 update to Sunbreak

* Pick a folder
* The program will search for any .pfb files within the subfolders
* Will copy the folder to a new conversion folder to avoid messing with the originals
* Attempt to convert old prefab files to new prefab format

I've tried this on all the mods I currently have, Elden ring hairstyle, Physics enabler etc. only issue was the female animations pack.
