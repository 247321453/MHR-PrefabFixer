# MHR-PrefabFixer
Prefab Fixer for the v11 update to Sunbreak

* Pick a folder
* The program will search for any .pfb files within the subfolders
* Will copy the folder to a new conversion folder to avoid messing with the originals
* Attempt to convert old prefab files to new prefab format

I've tried this on all the mods I currently have, Elden ring hairstyle, Physics enabler etc. only issue was the female animations pack.

Note: Please be aware that this fixes the body/hair meshes. Weapons are not included as those have undergone, quite a bit of a change compared to a simple byte change. It it being looked into, but may take a while. In the meantime, alphaZomega has released a new version of their 010 editor script to fix the remaining weapon issue, so feel free to grab their script and run it against your prefabs.
